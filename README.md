ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Enthusiast and ServiceNow Developer with over 3 years of experience in backend development, project management, and guiding team members on coding best practices. My main tech stack includes PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (jQuery), Python, and ServiceNow, and Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and technologies to expand my skills.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™ve worked on a range of customer-facing web systems, from quiz platforms to real estate posting systems, and have experience with AWS EC2 deployments. I enjoy tackling both backend and frontend challenges and aim to bring quality, scalable solutions to every project I work on.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into full-stack development and AI-driven solutions to stay at the forefront of the industry. Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and believe that knowledge sharing is essential for growth.

ðŸš€ Outside of coding, Iâ€™m interested in game design, inspired by classic Nintendo games, and participate in fun runs to keep pushing my personal limits.
